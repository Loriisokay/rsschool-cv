## About me
I am an aspiring rookie developer based in Almaty, Kazakhstan. There is nothing more exciting than learning new things! The thing that I now strive to master is web-development. Choosing the path of learning this truly magical technology, I've focused not only on the acquiring the essential stack, but also on the improvement of my problem-solving skills. Moreover, I work on becoming a better companion for my future colleagues. Right now, my main goal is to become a real professional in the field and I will not stop until I achieve it!

```
